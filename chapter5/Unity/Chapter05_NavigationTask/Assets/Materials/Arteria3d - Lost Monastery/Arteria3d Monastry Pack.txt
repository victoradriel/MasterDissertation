Thankyou for purchasing the Arteria3d Monastry Pack

You will find various folders within the zip - simply select the model format you wish to use from the Model
Formats Folder, i.e. B3D, then put this into the Texture folder named 'use these' which are DDS textures
and 1 jpeg.

We also provide the textures in JPEG format as these have been requested in the past.



Normal maps are also provided

Torque3d users - if you wish to use DAE format, please use the DAE files within the TORQUE folder as these and the DTS are scaled to torque scale.


Enjoy!

Steve, Arteria3d Visionary
